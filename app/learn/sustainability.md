Sustainability in agriculture is becoming increasingly important as we face challenges such as climate change, resource scarcity, and population growth. This app demonstrates how advanced modeling and control can contribute to more sustainable greenhouse operations.

### Understanding the Results Table

After running your simulation, the app provides a detailed breakdown of:

- **Lettuce Profit**: Revenue generated from biomass growth
- **Energy Costs**: Separated by actuator (fan, heater, humidifier, CO₂ generator)
- **CO₂ Emissions**: Environmental impact of each actuator's operation
- **Total Profit**: The bottom line after accounting for all costs

### Sustainability Challenges in Agriculture

Traditional agriculture faces significant sustainability challenges:

- Consumes nearly 70% of global freshwater resources
- Contributes to deforestation and soil degradation
- Requires large land areas with suitable climate conditions

Controlled environment agriculture offers potential solutions through:

- Reduced water consumption (up to 90% less than conventional farming)
- Higher yields per unit area (10-20 times more productive)
- Year-round production regardless of external climate
- Precise application of nutrients with minimal waste

### Carbon Footprint Calculation

Our framework explicitly accounts for carbon emissions in two ways:

1. **Direct CO₂ Accounting**:
   $ E_{\text{CO}_2}(u) = \frac{I_{\text{CO}_2} \Delta t}{1000 \times 3600} P(u) $

2. **Social Cost of Carbon**:
   $ C_{\text{CO}_2}(u) = C_{\text{CO}_2\text{cost}} E_{\text{CO}_2}(u) $

Where:

- $ I_{\text{CO}_2} $ is the carbon intensity in gCO₂eq/kWh
- $ P(u) $ is the power consumption of actuators
- $ C_{\text{CO}_2\text{cost}} $ is the social cost of carbon emissions

By including these terms in the objective function, the controller optimizes for reduced carbon impact alongside economic considerations.

### Economic-Environmental Trade-offs

The app demonstrates important sustainability trade-offs:

- **Higher CO₂ Enrichment**: Increases yield but raises both costs and emissions
- **Increased Heating**: Can accelerate growth but consumes more energy
- **Ventilation Management**: Affects temperature and humidity with energy implications

Our research using this model has shown that:

- Including the social cost of carbon in the objective function reduced CO₂ consumption by 15%
- This decreased plant growth by 11%
- But reduced profit by only 3%

This reveals that significant environmental benefits can be achieved with modest economic impact.

### How to Improve Sustainability

You can make your greenhouse more sustainable by:

1. **Adjusting Control Ranges**: Limiting maximum heating or CO₂ enrichment
2. **Choosing Better Locations**: Areas with milder climates require less energy
3. **Optimizing Prediction Horizon**: Longer horizons can lead to more efficient resource use
4. **Selecting Favorable Seasons**: Aligning growth cycles with optimal natural conditions

### Experiment Ideas

Try these experiments to explore sustainability concepts:

1. **Compare Locations**: Run the same setup in different climate zones
2. **Seasonal Variations**: Test winter versus summer growing in the same location
3. **Carbon Cost Impact**: Observe how different carbon intensities affect optimization
4. **Energy Price Sensitivity**: See how the controller adapts to varying energy costs

### Educational Value

Studying sustainability through greenhouse modeling provides valuable perspectives:

1. **Systems Thinking**: Understand how agricultural systems interact with environmental, economic, and social factors
2. **Trade-off Analysis**: Visualize and quantify the relationships between economic and environmental objectives
3. **Technology Integration**: Learn how advanced control can bridge sustainability goals with practical implementation
4. **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Experience how to use real-time data to make more sustainable operational decisions

By exploring these trade-offs, you gain practical insight into how advanced control techniques can balance profitability with environmental responsibility.

### Real-World Applications

The insights gained from this app can be applied to:

- Designing more energy-efficient greenhouse structures
- Planning optimal growing seasons and locations
- Making informed decisions about climate control investments
- Understanding the economics of sustainable agriculture
