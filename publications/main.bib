  abstract = {Validation results are presented of a dynamic crop growth model of lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) previously used in a greenhouse climate optimization study. The model describes the dynamic behaviour of two state variables, the non-structural dry weight and the structural dry weight, as affected by the incident photosynthetically active radiation, the carbon dioxide concentration and the air temperature in the greenhouse. Model equations and parameters have been collected from the literature. Because in the control study the economic return of a lettuce cultivation was considered to be determined by total crop dry weight, the model's ability to describe the dynamic behaviour of the dry matter content of a lettuce crop has been evaluated. Comparison of simulations with data obtained in two growth experiments showed that the growth model was able to describe with satisfactory accuracy the dry matter production of lettuces cultivated according to standard horticultural practice.},

Local and global convergence properties of this method were analyzed in previous work. Here we provide a comprehensive description of the algorithm, including the feasibility restoration phase for the filter method, second-order corrections, and inertia correction of the KKT matrix. Heuristics are also considered that allow faster performance. This method has been implemented in the IPOPT code, which we demonstrate in a detailed numerical study based on 954 problems from the CUTEr test set. An evaluation is made of several line-search options, and a comparison is provided with two state-of-the-art interior-point codes for nonlinear programming.},
