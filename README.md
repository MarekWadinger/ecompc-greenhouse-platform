## üåç Overview

**EcoMPC4Greenhouse** is an interactive, web-based platform aimed at enhancing education in Nonlinear Economic Model Predictive Control (NEMPC) applied to greenhouse climate management. By integrating real-time data and dynamic simulations, the platform enables students and researchers to explore how to optimize greenhouse systems for sustainability, balancing plant growth, energy use, and CO‚ÇÇ emissions.

Developed to support the publication *"Carbon Neutral Greenhouse: Economic Model Predictive Control Framework for Education,"* the platform provides hands-on learning with advanced control techniques, bridging theory and practical agricultural applications.

## üöÄ Features

- **Greenhouse Climate Model**: Simulates lettuce growth dynamics influenced by external weather data, temperature, light, and CO‚ÇÇ concentration.
- **Economic MPC Framework**: Optimizes climate conditions to balance crop yield, energy consumption, and CO‚ÇÇ emissions.
- **Real-Time Data Integration**: Fetches **[üå¶Ô∏è weather forecast](https://open-meteo.com)**, **[üò∂‚Äçüå´Ô∏è carbon intensity forecasts](https://api.electricitymap.org)** and **[‚ö°Ô∏è electricity price](https://newtransparency.entsoe.eu/)** to adjust the greenhouse control strategy.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive design for students to visualize simulations, analyze results, and experiment with control parameters.
- **Educational Focus**: Aimed at bridging the gap between control theory and real-world applications, enhancing problem-solving skills through interactive learning.
